                Introduction:
            </h2>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams
             of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
            a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at 
            each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) 
            balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting
            team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of 
            either wicket holding bats, while one player from the
            fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the 
            striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. 
            The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the 
            bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with 
            the batting team scoring one run for each of these 
            exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches 
            the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled 
            illegally.
            The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being 
            scored by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). 
            Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the 
            ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, 
            and by the fielding side either catching the ball after 
            it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or 
            hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross 
            the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters 
            have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends 
            and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from 
            traditional Test matches played over five days to the
            newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which 
            each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs 
            (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities 
            for the batting team to score) and the game generally 
            lasts three to four hours.
            Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but 
            in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. 
            In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective 
            gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a 
            hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a 
            slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered 
            with tightly wound string.
